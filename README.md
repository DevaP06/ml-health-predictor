# 🧠 ML Health Risk Predictor

A machine learning-based web application that predicts the risk of a person having heart-related issues based on various symptoms and conditions. This project uses classification models trained on a medical dataset and offers a user-friendly web interface for predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts heart-related health risk from 17+ symptom inputs
- Trained ML model (`model.pkl`) using a cleaned dataset
- Web interface built with Flask
- Modular code for training and inference
